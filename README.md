# Quick R Build
Prounounced "Quicker Build", it is a web app designed to quickly personalize resumes from a predeclared master resume. Quickly pick and chooose what and what not to include in your resume and let the app do the rest.

Moved from "Andy & Sean" organization. Development will continue here but a copy remains associated with that organization.

# Development
- `next-dev` branch is a first look at UI elements - Navbar and potential design for resume entries included
- `resume-logic` branch is data abstraction, attempting to store resume info in JSON and manipulate it appropriately
- `dev/andoiii/startover` branch is Andoiii's attempt to restart project. App Router instead of Page Router, contexts to store resume, prettier site with responsiveness and more flair, use of tailwind.
